## Workshop Hands-on Machine Learning in R, September 2021 edition

by Katrien Antonio, Jonas Crevecoeur and Roel Henckaerts

Course materials for the *Hands-on Machine Learning in R* course (September 2021).

`r emo::ji("calendar")` Module 1 on September 7 & 8, 2021, Module 2 on September 9 & 10, 2021 and Module 3 on September 13 & 14, 2021
<br>
`r emo::ji("clock")` From 9.00 am to 12.00 pm or from 1.30 pm to 4.30 pm
<br>
`r emo::ji("location")` online, organized by Capgemini Academy and Nationale Nederlanden

Course materials will be posted in the week before the workshop. You are now on the landing page for **Module 1: ML foundations and regression models**.

## Prework

<p align="justify">The workshop requires a basic understanding of R. A good starting level is the material covered in the [werkt-U-al-met-R?](https://github.com/katrienantonio/werkt-U-al-met-R) 
repo on Katrien's GitHub.</p>

Familiarity with statistical or machine learning methods is *not* required. The workshop gradually builds up these concepts, with an emphasis on hands-on demonstrations and exercises.

The R and RStudio software should be up and running before coming to the workshop. Please visit the **Software requirements** posted below.

## Overview

<p text-align="justify"> This workshop introduces the *essential concepts of building machine learning models with R*. Throughout the workshop you will gain insights in the foundations of machine learning methods, including *resampling methods*, *data preprocessing steps* and the *tuning of parameters*. You will cover a variety of *statistical and machine learning methods*, ranging from GLMs, over tree-based machine learning methods to neural networks. You will acquire insights in the foundations of these methods, learn how to set-up the model building process, and focus on building a good understanding of the resulting model output and predictions.</p> 

<p align="justify">Leaving this workshop, you should have a firm grasp of the working principles of a variety of machine learning methods and be able to explore their use in practical settings. Moreover, you should have acquired the fundamental insights to explore some other methods on your own.</p> 

## Schedule and Course Material

The schedule will gradually be completed over the next days. The detailed schedule is subject to small changes.

##### Module 1: Machine learning foundations, regression methods

In two sessions we cover: 

- statistical and machine learning: a tour
- machine learning foundations, including resampling with `caret` and `rsample` 
- feature pre-processing steps, including setting up a blue-print with `recipes`
- regression models, including regularization: `lm()`, `glm()`, `mgcv()`, `glmnet()`

## Software Requirements

You have **two options** to join the coding exercises covered during the
workshop. Either you join the RStudio cloud workspace dedicated to the
workshop, and then you'll run R in the cloud, from your browser. Or you
use your local installation of R and RStudio.

We kindly ask participants to **join the RStudio Cloud as default**! 

### RStudio Cloud - default!

You will join our workspace on R Studio Cloud. This
enables a **very accessible set-up** for working with R in the cloud
for the less experienced user!

[https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/109060/join?access_code=s3jVNlJn6J8SlZpSXmwvBsCMUC3XicxoFv5kCbCO](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/109060/join?access_code=s3jVNlJn6J8SlZpSXmwvBsCMUC3XicxoFv5kCbCO)

Here are the steps you should take (before the workshop):

- visit the above link
- log in by creating an account for RStudio Cloud or by using your Google or GitHub login credentials
- join the space
- at the top of your screen you see ‘Projects’, click ‘Projects’
- with the ‘copy’ button (on the right) you can make your own version of the ‘Module 1 - Foundations of ML and regression’ project; in this copy you can work on the exercises, add comments etc.
- you should now be able to visit the project and see the ‘scripts’ and ‘data’ folders on the right. Open and run the ‘installation-instructions.R’ script from the scripts folder, to see if everything works fine.

We will have everything set up for you in the correct way. You only have to login!

### Local installation

Alternatively, you can bring a laptop with a recent version of R and RStudio installed.
Make sure you can connect your laptop to the internet (or download the
course material one day before the start of the workshop). You will
need:

  - R (at least 3.5.2 <https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>)
  - RStudio
    (<https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>)

In the `prework` folder you will find a step-by-step guide to installing R and RStudio (though a bit outdated). 

Please **run the below script** in your R session to install the
required packages.

Make sure to **download the course material** (including scripts and data sets) from the GitHub repo one day before the workshop. Use the green button Code > Download ZIP on the GitHub repo website. As a final step, after downloading, unpack the ZIP folder and make sure you can easily access the material (in particular scripts and data sets).

```{r eval=FALSE}
packages <- c("tidyverse", "here", "rstudioapi", "MASS", "AmesHousing",  "caret", "rsample", "purrr", "recipes", "broom", "mgcv", "glmnet", "gridExtra")

new_packages <- packages[!(packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new_packages)) install.packages(new_packages)

if(sum(!(packages %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"]))) {
  stop(paste('The following required packages are not installed:\n', 
             paste(packages[which(!(packages %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"]))], collapse = ', ')));
} else {
  message("Everything is set up correctly. You are ready to go.")
}
```

These instructions can also be downloaded as .R script from the
`scripts` folder. Open this script in RStudio (via File > Open file),
select the code and press the Run button top right in the script window.
